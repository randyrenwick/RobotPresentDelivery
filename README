Robot Simulation

I wanted to do something with node.js for this project but I haven't worked with it before.  
I did want to demonstrate that I can at least code in javascript so I put together a crude vanilla HTML interface to interact with my js functions to demo it.
So, please excuse the awfulness of my crude GUI.  
I'm keen to learn node.js and a modern frontend library such as React/Angular.


TODO list:
- make a real interface...
- remove console.log debug values
- turn robots.js into Object so possible to manage multiple simulations at once
- functions to return error codes instead of just true/false results
